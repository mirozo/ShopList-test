Motivation

When you shop online, you’re often able to compare products and their prices across different retailers to make the 
best purchasing decision.However, such a process is highly time consuming for grocery shopping
 - a necessity for nearly all households. Moreover, expenditure tracking proves to be a hassle with grocery shopping 
yielding physical receipts.

Aim

We aim to help people keep track of their offline purchases as easily as their online purchases, with the same ability 
to compare the options of different retailers.

Scope of Project

1) Function as a grocery list. For each item of the list, provide insights such as average price of product and where you 
can find them. Give users an idea of their total expenditure for that specific list and allows them to calculate monthly 
or yearly expenditure based on that shopping list.

2) The mobile application provides its users with a platform to digitise their paper receipts, logging its contents and 
allowing users to track their purchase patterns. Based on this information, the mobile application will give them an 
analysis of their expenditure better financial accountability.

3) Searches for the item across different retailers and provide comparisons in pricing across those retailers. 
Provides other insights on products such as nutritional values or other certification (eg. Halal/ Healthier Choice)
